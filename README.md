# Suraksha

**Suraksha** is a platform where user can register so that he/she can get a notification whenever there is some warning of any kind of calamity in his locality. User position coordinates will get updated at a regular interval automatically on our platforms database which can be used to track the last location where person was present,  in case of disaster or natural calamity.

**Platforms**

There will be a website and also an android application. Both website and android application can be used by an user to register to our services. The android application will fetch the location with the help of GPS services. 

**Functions**
-   If the platform stops receiving updates from user for some period(say,one day), we will treat it as a danger and his last updated location details will be sent to his trusted contacts and in case of any disaster we will mark the location to guide the rescue team to the victim.

-   The platform will be open to organisations who can provide prior notification about a disaster in a particular geographical location. Since we also have the data of the location of different users, we will scan through all the locations and if a location falls under the affected area the user will be notified about the disaster through SMS.
	
-   Our database will also have data of different hospitals and pharmaceuticals. The data can be used to inform hospitals and pharmaceuticals located in the disaster prone area to prepare for any  upcoming disaster by increasing their supplies.

-	Our app will allow emergency response crews to immediately connect with survivors and direct their attention accordingly providing them real time updates of the the survivors location.
