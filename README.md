# Suraksha

**Suraksha** is a platform where user can register so that he/she can get a notification whenever there is some warning of any kind of calamity in his locality. User position coordinates will get updated at a regular interval automatically on our platforms database which can be used to track the last location where person was present,  in case of disaster or natural calamity.

-   If the platform stops receiving updates from user for some period, his last updated location details will be sent to his trusted contacts.

-   The platform will be open to organisations who can provide prior notification about a disaster in a particular
	geographical location. Since we also have the data of the location of different users, we can send them an alert through a broadcast.
	
-	We will also inform hospitals and pharmaceuticals located in the disaster prone area to prepare for any 	 upcoming disaster by increasing their supplies.
